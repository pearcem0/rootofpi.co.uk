## AWS Security GameDay

Run with the Peak Engineering team, Security V2 is the second in the series of security themed AWS GameDays.

Players joined us as brand new hires to the Unicorn.Rentals security team, and not a minute too soon! 
Just that morning there were some (disputed) reports that Unicorn.Rentals was breached. ðŸ˜²

We needed the help of our new hires to restore customer confidence in the Unicorn.Rentals brand by addressing some opportunities for improvement in our architectures.

Over the course of about three hours, including 2.5 hours of hands on work in AWS, our new hires (the Peak team!) tackled the five most critical security issues impacting Unicorn.Rentals using manual and automated techniques across services like Amazon RDS, Amazon EC2, Amazon Inspector, Amazon GuardDuty, Amazon Config and more!
