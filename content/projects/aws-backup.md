## Talk given at AWS North meetup group

aws-rotate-backup was created to provide easy backups/images for multiple EC2 instances (and in different regions) and rotating the backups weekly, keeping a backup image of the instance every week for 1 month at a time.

_Disclaimer_: As I know now, not using good or best practices, A fun learning experience none the less!
