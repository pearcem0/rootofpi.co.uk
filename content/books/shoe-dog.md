## Phil Knight

A memoir by the creator of Nike.

Quite a complelling recollection of where it all began for Nike - trials and tribulations included. 

True story, while the weather was good and I was sat outside reading the book in various places around the city three different people stopped to say they'd read the book and really enjoyed it!
