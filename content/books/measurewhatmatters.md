## John Doerr

An interesting follow up to Andy Groves “High Output Management”; guiding the reader to data driven success with a number of additional pearls of wisdom, even with bonus resources at the back of the book.

Build an environment that emphasises output, but beware the activity trap - the belief that output = productivity, and therefore increasing activity’s, which doesn’t necessarily produce value.
