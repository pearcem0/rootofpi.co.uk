## Haruki Murakami

A trippy one, which I guess you could in part classify as sci-fi. There were uncomfortable parts, but something hypnotic about the time travel, eery coincidences, and profecies that saved it for me. Interestingly alternating chapters read through two distinct but later (as the book progresses) interrelated plots.
