## A novel by Susanna Clarke

Piranesiâ€™s house is no ordinary building: its rooms are infinite, its corridors endless, its walls are lined with thousands upon thousands of statues, each one different from all the others. Within the labyrinth of halls an ocean is imprisoned; waves thunder up staircases, rooms are flooded in an instant. But Piranesi is not afraid; he understands the tides as he understands the pattern of the labyrinth itself. He lives to explore the house.A thought-provoking and business-focused look at problems and missed opportunities within the field and practice of Information Security for business and security leaders alike.
