## Tom Rath

An interesting charity shop pickup.

Not the actual ‘Strength Finder 2.0’ assessment, but the themes and ideas for actions to apply your strengths discover strengths and develop natural talents. This doubled up as a very insightful read about many different talent and personality types/traits and how to action them or work with others who possess them.
