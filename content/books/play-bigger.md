## How Pirates, Dreamers, and Innovators Create and Dominate Markets

Reading Play Bigger again, properly this time (it was a bit rushed last time, but still great). 

There is a lot to relate to, especially reading it again with more hindsight. There are often questions and frustrations that books like this help clarify and subdue. 
I started writing things down things to review, gave up and took photos instead, then spent too long taking photos so will just recommend reading the whole book instead! 

Playing bigger is not about getting lucky - we all have the same odds, itâ€™s about doing everything in your power to increase your odds.
