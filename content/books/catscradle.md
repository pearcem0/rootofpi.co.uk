## Kurt Vonnegut

A satirical novel about politics, religion, and the end of the world. A fascinating account of a character by the name of Felix Hoenikker, father of the modern day atomic bomb. Dr. H however was actually based on a certain Doctor Irving Langmuir, who left a much less ruinous legacy.
